  This project was created and written by Omar Jandali for a Udacity FEND project: Neighborhood Map
-->

<!--
  instructions:
    download knockout framework to hand the following
      creating markers
      tracking clicks
      events on markers
      making the map
      refreshing the map
      all click events
      **creating the markers should be a pert of the VIewModel(do no create them as knockout observables)
    Asynchronous and Error handling
      load all the data from the API asynchronously
      errors should be handled gracefully
      3rd party errors
        message notifying the user the data is not loading (or)
        there are no negative repercussions to the UI

        *** should be able to handle errors if the browser has trouble initially reaching 3rd party app***
        give the users the best possible experience that they can have with different errors

    Load a fill screen map to your page using Google Map API
      the http link that should be used to call the map as follows:
        script src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places&key=[YOUR_API_KEY](include within script tags)
    Markers
      write the code required to display 5 map markers of different locations that you are interested in within your neighborhood
    implement a list view of the set of locations
    filter
      create filter options that uses the input field to filter the list view as well as the markers displayed by default (text or drop down menu for user to select from)
    Functionality
      when a map marker is clicked, use a 3rd party api to supplement more information about the specific location
      (steetciew and places dont count as additional third party api) MUST PROVIDE ATTRIBUTES AND DATA SOURCE
    Animation
      animate the map marker when the list item is selected or items associated with the reletive marker
    infowindow
      populate the info window with information that is pulled about a specific location (minimum = location name)
    intuitive use
      everything in the map should be easy to use with minimal work required to do things like location input items or filtering items
      you should be able to understand how the interface works without any effort and research involved
